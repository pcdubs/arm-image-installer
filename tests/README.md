## Test Details

### test-server-basic.sh
- Downloads latest Server image from Koji (~5-8 GB download)
- Creates a basic custom image with minimal options

## Environment Variables

### CACHE_DIR
Directory for cached downloaded images (default: `/var/tmp/arm-image-installer-test-cache`)

```bash
CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache ./test-server-basic.sh
```

### TEST_OUTPUT_DIR
Directory for test outputs and custom images (default: `/var/tmp/arm-image-installer-tests`)

```bash
TEST_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output ./test-server-basic.sh
```

### FEDORA_VERSION
Fedora version to test (default: `43`)

```bash
FEDORA_VERSION=44 ./test-server-basic.sh
```

**Note**: These environment variables can also be set in TMT plans. See `tests/plans/*.fmf` files for examples.

## CI Integration

### GitHub Actions

Tests are automatically run via GitHub Actions on pull requests. The workflow:
- Runs on x86_64 Ubuntu runners (standard GitHub-hosted)
- Downloads real Fedora ARM images from Koji
- Creates custom disk images using `arm-image-installer`
- Verifies the image structure and modifications
- Does not require QEMU or nested virtualization

### Packit (Optional)

Tests can also run via Packit on pull requests. The `.packit.yaml` configuration includes:

```yaml
jobs:
  - job: tests
    trigger: pull_request
    targets:
      - fedora-stable
      - fedora-development
    tf_extra_params:
      environments:
        - arch: aarch64
```

Tests run on actual aarch64 hardware in Fedora's Testing Farm.

## Caching

Downloaded images are cached in `CACHE_DIR` to speed up repeated test runs. The cache persists between runs, so subsequent tests only need to download images once.

To clear the cache:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/arm-image-installer-test-cache
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test fails with "Failed to mount root partition"
Ensure you're running the test with root/sudo privileges. The verification script needs to mount the image to check its contents.

### Download fails
Check network connectivity to `kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org`. You may need to adjust firewall rules.

### Out of disk space
Tests require significant disk space:
- Basic test: ~6-8 GB (downloaded image + output)
- Full customization test: ~26-28 GB (downloaded image + 20GB output image)
- IoT test: ~6-8 GB (downloaded image + output)

Use `df -h` to check available space and clean up old test outputs in `TEST_OUTPUT_DIR`:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/arm-image-installer-tests
```

### Verification fails for customizations
If verification fails to find SSH keys, Wi-Fi configs, etc., check that:
- The script ran without errors during image creation
- You're checking the right partition (verify-image.sh looks for p3 or p2)
- The filesystem is ext4 or another Linux filesystem that can be mounted

### Test partially completed
If a test fails partway through, you may have leftover files:
- Downloaded images in `$CACHE_DIR` (safe to keep for reuse)
- Output images in `$TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` (can be removed to free space)
- Temporary SSH keys in `$TEST_OUTPUT_DIR/test_rsa*`

To clean up and retry:
```bash
# Keep downloaded images, remove test outputs
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/arm-image-installer-tests

# Or clean everything including cached downloads
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/arm-image-installer-tests /var/tmp/arm-image-installer-test-cache
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Create a test script in `tests/`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x tests/test-name.sh`
3. Add a TMT plan in `tests/plans/name.fmf`
4. Document the test in this README
5. Test locally before submitting PR
